You're so damn electrocute!

Who are those great looking dolls?
It's quick curl-Barbie and mod-hair Ken!
But what do I do with my old Barbie?

S-U-B-A-R-B-I-E-A, S-U-B-A-R-B-I-E-A
Yeah, Su-Barbie-A

Oh, honey!

I feel fantastic, hey hey hey

No biggie!

Now, you are not, uh
Being the real adult in this
Not with this hair, and not with this dress!
Honestly, I feel like I'm celebrating
(Barbie) And I love

Girl, be honest

I need glitter!

Doll!
Fuzzy fuzzy cute cute!
Barbie's changed, Barbie's new and different!
Even if they don't like me, they all know me

I identify this as iron pyrite

Pixel Chix

Be who you wanna be, girl!
B-A-R-B-I-E
Tanner wants a treat!
So cute! Oh excuse us!
You potty trained Tanner, Barbie!
Barbie girl

Immaterial girls
I could be anything I want
Anyhow, any place, anywhere, anyone
Any form, any shape, anyway, anything, anything I want
