You're so damn electrocute!

Who are those great looking dolls?
It's quick curl-Barbie and mod-hair Ken!
But what do I do with my old Barbie?

S-U-B-A-R-B-I-E-A, S-U-B-A-R-B-I-E-A
Yeah, Su-Barbie-A

Oh, honey!

I feel fantastic, hey hey hey

Though you may not know where your gifts may lead
And it may not show at the start
When you live your dreams
You'll find destiny
Is written in your heart

Today is gonna ROCK!

Now, you are not, uh
Being the real adult in this
Not with this hair, and not with this dress!
Honestly, I feel like I'm celebrating
(Barbie) And I love

Girl, be honest

Math is hard

I need glitter!

It's KKB! Let's go!
走って登って撃って跳んで
Tomb Raiderになりたいんだ
かっこ良くて強くて
憧れなんだTomb Raider
Windows 98, remember those days?
夢中になって遊んだevery day
誰にも負けない諦めない
自分に誓ったあのころnever fades
Time warp! I'm 22 years old
大人の世界に change over
秘境で嘘つき駆け引きfor money
Hard to keep up always stopping me but
忘れない逃げない絶対
あのころ自分 突き通せ
あの心　あのハート
1, 2, 3
進んでto the next level
Whichever console you play
No matter how many hours a day
I could win at any game
Whether you're a boy, or a girl, or a super computer
It's often said I should get some girly hobbies instead
But that thought fills me with dread
I'm not into sewing, baking, dress-making
Not eating, bitching, submitting

Oh, we're late, late, late. We have twenty, maximum twenty-two minutes, for your royal fitting.
And then it's move, move, move to your speech at the Historical Society.
After that, we have to rush, and I mean rush, to the Horticultural Society Tea.
And then there's your math lessons, your geography lessons, your science lessons-

Doll!
Fuzzy fuzzy cute cute!
Barbie's changed, Barbie's new and different!
Even if they don't like me, they all know me

I identify this as iron pyrite

Pixel Chix

Be who you wanna be, girl!
B-A-R-B-I-E
Tanner wants a treat!
So cute! Oh excuse us!
You potty trained Tanner, Barbie!
Barbie girl

No biggie!

Immaterial girls
I could be anything I want
Anyhow, any place, anywhere, anyone
Any form, any shape, anyway, anything, anything I want

"I have E-Mail!"
Computers are so cool!
