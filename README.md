## Assignment Description
> In this assignment, you will explore how digital media can be used to extend, augment, or distort our understanding of time, space and place.
>
> I would like you to create a webVR space that  functions as a window into an “in-between” territory. It may be useful to think about what it means to exist in between physical and virtual space. Is it possible to exist in a fully offline or physical state? What does it mean to be stuck between physical and digital space? Other words to consider: borderline, fringe, peripheral, liminal.
>
> Think about how your space functions. Is it based upon a real place?
>
> How do you define territory? A territory can be macroscopic, microscopic, it can be the size of your bedroom, etc.
>
> How do we navigate and move through your space? How many dimensions does your space have?
>
> How does time function?
>
> How does sound function?

## Artist Statement
My project is inspired by early-2000s girls' toys sites like Barbie.com and Polly Pocket, and what they taught me about what it means to be a girl in the age of the internet.
