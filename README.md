## Assignment Description
> In this assignment, you will explore how digital media can be used to extend, augment, or distort our understanding of time, space and place.
>
> I would like you to create a webVR space that  functions as a window into an “in-between” territory. It may be useful to think about what it means to exist in between physical and virtual space. Is it possible to exist in a fully offline or physical state? What does it mean to be stuck between physical and digital space? Other words to consider: borderline, fringe, peripheral, liminal.
>
> Think about how your space functions. Is it based upon a real place?
>
> How do you define territory? A territory can be macroscopic, microscopic, it can be the size of your bedroom, etc.
>
> How do we navigate and move through your space? How many dimensions does your space have?
>
> How does time function?
>
> How does sound function?

## Artist Statement
'Electrocute' is inspired by early-2000s girls' toys sites like Barbie.com and PollyPocket.com, and what they taught me about what it means to be a girl in the age of the internet. These sites instilled girls of my generation with both good and bad ideas. Some of the good concepts I sought to reflect are the prioritization of female comraderie, the ubiquity of positive attitudes ("Today is gonna ROCK!"), and examples of women using their smarts to solve problems. Some of the bad concepts include the emphasis on beauty, fashion, and makeup; the reenforcement of socioeconomic status in online spaces; and the tokenism of people of color.

While the project mostly focuses on early-2000s girls' sites, I also wanted to examine how these sites influenced how I grew up as a feminist on the internet. To that end,the project also incorporates contemporary inspirations and lyrics from womxn musicians that engage with egirl aesthetics or cyberfeminism, like Doja Cat, Janelle Monae, and Sarah Bonito. These artists represent in many ways how I have grown as a feminist and their viewpoints also show how the rhetoric presented to young girls is quite different from when I was young. For example, the band Kero Kero Bonito, of which Sarah Bonito (Sarah Midori Perry) is the frontman, has a song called 'Sick Beat' which is largely written in Japanese. This song examines not only what it is like to be a woman in the age of computers, but also how multicultural identity influences a woman's identity. Some of the lyrics to this song are included in the scrolling text in my piece, but the Japanese characters render as question marks.

The environment of Electrocute is simultaneously nostalgic and futuristic, and completely feminine.
